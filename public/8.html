    <h2><strong>Question:</strong> How could we improve or alter this familiarization exercise?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I personally like the platform and and also what Vercel is building and solving for the front-end, Only challenge would be for folks who have not done front-end in their past due to which it may take sometime for them to do the exercise. Also, it would be great to have small sample videos linked into your documentation to understand quick concepts which are not understandable generally something like on Edge Functions, Serverless Functions and Edge Middleware .. </p>
