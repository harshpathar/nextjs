      <p>To help mitigate overages related to serverless function execution for a new customer on Next.js and Vercel, here are some steps and strategies you can try:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Understanding Function Execution Limits</strong>: First, it is important to understands the execution limits and pricing model for serverless functions on Vercel. The billing is calculated based on the number of function invocations, execution time, and memory usage.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Efficient Code Practices</strong>: It is highly encouraged to write efficient code for the serverless functions. Optimizing functions to execute quickly and minimize resource usage is important. Techniques such as caching, batching requests, and optimizing algorithms can help reduce the number of function invocations and execution time.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Caching</strong>: Implementing caching mechanisms wherever appropriate to reduce the need for frequent function invocations. Use caching at various levels, such as in-memory caching within functions, caching responses at the CDN level, or using external caching services.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Request Batching</strong>: If applicable, we would suggest batching multiple requests into a single serverless function invocation. This can help reduce the number of function executions and improve overall efficiency.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Monitoring and Analysis</strong>: We sincerely advise you to regularly monitor your serverless function usage and performance. Utilize Vercel's monitoring tools to analyze function execution metrics, identify bottlenecks, and optimize accordingly.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Auto-Scaling Configuration</strong>: It is important that you have configured auto-scaling appropriately for your serverless functions. Auto-scaling allows Vercel to automatically adjust the number of function instances based on demand, helping to mitigate overages during periods of high traffic.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Usage Alerts and Notifications</strong>: Set up usage alerts and notifications within Vercel when you are approaching your function execution limits or experiencing increased usage. This proactive approach allows to take necessary action before encountering overages.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>Billing and Cost Monitoring</strong>: How to monitor your billing and costs within the Vercel dashboard is something I would be happy to assit you with and help you understand. Regularly review billing statements and usage reports to identify any unexpected spikes in function usage and take appropriate measures to mitigate overages.</p>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>By following these steps and strategies, you can effectively mitigate overages related to serverless function execution while maximizing the efficiency and performance of your Next.js application deployed on Vercel.</p>
