    <h2><strong>Question:</strong> A customer has reached out asking, “When should I choose to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware with Vercel?” Write a reply to the customer.</h2>
  <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light">
   <p>Choosing between Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, and Edge Middleware in Vercel depends on your specific use case and requirements:</p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <p><strong>Edge Functions</strong>:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Use Edge Functions when you need to execute logic directly at the edge, closer to the user's location.</li>
            <li>Edge Functions are executed at Vercel's global edge network, which helps in reducing latency for your users.</li>
            <li>Ideal for tasks like URL rewriting, security headers injection, A/B testing, etc., that need to be executed quickly and close to the user.</li>
            <li>Edge Functions are written in JavaScript and executed by Vercel's Edge Network.</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p><strong>Serverless Functions</strong>:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Use Serverless Functions when you need to execute backend logic in response to HTTP requests.</li>
            <li>Serverless Functions run in response to HTTP requests, similar to traditional server-side code but without the need to manage infrastructure.</li>
            <li>They are ideal for handling API requests, form submissions, authentication, database operations, etc.</li>
            <li>Serverless Functions can be written in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, or other supported languages.</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p><strong>Edge Middleware</strong>:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Use Edge Middleware when you need to intercept and modify incoming HTTP requests or outgoing responses.</li>
            <li>Middleware functions are executed on every request or response passing through Vercel's edge network.</li>
            <li>They are useful for tasks like modifying headers, caching, logging, authentication, etc., that need to be applied to multiple routes or functions.</li>
            <li>Edge Middleware is typically written in JavaScript and configured to run on specific routes or globally.</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>In summary:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Choose Edge Functions for logic that needs to be executed quickly and close to the user.</li>
      <li>Choose Serverless Functions for backend logic that needs to be executed in response to HTTP requests.</li>
      <li>Choose Edge Middleware for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests or responses passing through Vercel's edge network.</li>
   </ul>
