    <h2><strong>Question:</strong> Imagine that the customer from Question 4 responds with the following email.
“I’m so frustrated. I’ve been trying to make this work for hours and I just
can’t figure it out. It must be a platform issue so why don't you just fix it for
me instead of asking me questions.”
Write a reply to the customer addressing the concerns raised.</h2>
