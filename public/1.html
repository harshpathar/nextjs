    <h2><strong>Question:</strong> Describe how you solved a challenge that one of your previous teams faced. How did you determine your solution was successful?</h2>
    <p>Answer: I started my journey in BrowserStack with the Technical Automate Support team where I had to help customer rasing queries with a resolution.
    
    The challenge was that the dashboard where we showed the video execution logs and other various logs didn't help customers to figure out why a certain session failed with a common exception.
    
    The solution to which I raised with my product team to change the UI with better information sharing where I requested the team to add documentation links when an error occurs.
    
    The result was that on many scenarios when an error occurred in a session the dashboard was updated with the documentation link where customer could read more on the exception and avoid rasing tickets on our support platform which helped customer reduce the time to understand the issue and resolve sooner.</p>
